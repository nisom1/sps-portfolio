      <h1>Photo Gallery</h1>
      <p> I enjoy photographing small, uncommon moments, because those are the ones we tend to forget most. More grand events, like graduations, weddings, and the like, are always remembered. When we look back on those common, memorable times we think “Oh yes, I remember that!” and “Oh the best part of that was XYZ!” But those moments are always with us and don’t fade nearly as quickly as the small moments. </p> 
      <p> One of my favorite things when I look back at my camera roll and I’m taken back to a time or place in my life that I have completely forgotten about. I think it’s a bit scary when that happens, because without photos or videos or sometimes of connection to small moments in our life, we completely forget about them. The worst part is that sometimes these small moments are insignificant in the moment, but years later we might see the value in them, and this is why I so desperately want to hold onto the small moments.</p>
      <p> In this photo gallery there are some grand moments documented, but there are also small, easily forgotten moments – but they are just as important as every other time in my life. Most of these photos are quite random/in the moment. One of my favorites is Kaylie and Megan posing in front of a whiteboard that has the topic for our Calculus BC Exam outlined. Such a simple photo brings back memories from multiple semesters with great friends. A photo of Mr. Ranghi, my Calculus teacher, teaching us how atomic bombs are made (from a Chemistry standpoint). Or when, after a 5 hour drive to Kentucky, our family stopped at a Cracker Barrel, where my dad and I took 482039 videos and photos with my new fish-eye lense.</p>
      <p> It’s crazy how without these photos to capture these small moments, I would have completely forgotten about them. It’s so easy to pull up embarrassing moments or times when we came short of expectations. But with times like those, I like to scroll through the small, easily forgotten moments, to remind myself that the good will always outnumber the bad. </p>
