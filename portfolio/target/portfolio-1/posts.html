      <h1>Hidden Talent</h1>
      <p> I mainly consider this a hidden talent because growing up I was quite terrible at it.
          I’m not sure what happened, but somehow I got good.
          It began with my mom and her collegiate teammates.
          There was my mom and three other ladies, each with their own family.
          Starting when I was in kindergarten, all four families would go up to South Lake Tahoe every winter – 13 kids and 8 parents, 21 people total in one log cabin. </p>
      <p> But what was the hidden talent?</p>
      <p> Well, every year the parents would put all the kids in the “Ski School” so they could all ski on their own.
          And every year I would pizza my way down the hill and struggle to keep up with the group.
          Usually by the end of the week I would finally get my act together and be a quarter-of-the-way-decent.
          But then the trip would end and we’d go back to our 70° winters in the Bay Area.
          And a year later all the families would head back up to the log cabin and we’d get back to the ski slopes.
          And let me tell you, it was not like riding a bike. Maybe my muscles have short term memory loss, cause each year my muscles forgot how to keep me balanced, how to make smooth curves down the hill, and I would default to pizza-ing down the whole hill. </p>
      <p> But one year, I got my act together, and next thing you know I started taking more risks than ever. This past winter break I got a mild concussion, and was lucky that my tumbling slowed me down before I ran into a tree.
          Something about skiing, it gets so scary at times, and you really have to believe in yourself. Many times I get stuck on a part of the hill that is a really challenge, or I get lost and end up on an advanced route. It’s times like these where I tell myself the following: “You will get to the bottom. Idk how, but it has to happen, we can’t stay here forever.”
          “You can do this. Just because you haven’t done it, doesn’t mean you can’t.”
          “Drop all doubt. Any doubt means your knees will go weak, the mogul will catch you off balance, and you’ll go hurtling to your death.
          You need full, 100% confidence in yourself, and no shred of doubt.” </p>
      <p> Mantras like that get me down the toughest slopes and the roughest times in my own personal life. </p>
